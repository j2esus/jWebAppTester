#WebAppTester: Tester for online forms
#This program uses Selenium to open a web browser and run user written commands.
#Download Selenium controllers for your favorite browser (check your browser version)
#from https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/ and save it in the same folder with the program.
#Every line starting with #, is ignored.
#This program builds a tree the folder "scripts" and subfolders.
#The tree is composed of folders and actions in every txt file.
#If there is a file _start.txt, that file will be read and executed before proceeding to any other action in that folder.
#If there is a file _end.txt, that file will be read and executed after any other action in that folder.
#
#Folder Tree Examples
#[scripts]
#scripts/_start.txt
#scripts/_end.txt
#[scripts/management]
#scripts/management/_start.txt
#scripts/management/crearpregunta.txt
#scripts/management/listarpreguntas.txt
#
#If you request the execution of the command "scripts/management/listarpreguntas", the program will run these 
#commands in order:
#scripts/_start.txt
#scripts/management/_start.txt
#scripts/management/listarpreguntas.txt
#scripts/_end.txt
#
#The files _start.txt and _end.txt are not mandatory: they are justa a way to automate actions as authentication
#prior to work with a page or execute a logout after using a given page
#
#Every action is a set of instructions to be executed by your web browser.
#each instruction has the format "action={command}"
